# hashmap-rs

This repository contains an implementation of a HashMap in Rust, written from scratch.

## Overview

A HashMap is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, retrieval, and deletion of key-value pairs. It does this by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for constant time O(1) operations on average.

## Usage

To use the HashMap, clone this repository and import the `HashMap` module into your project. You can then create a new instance of the `HashMap` struct and use its methods to insert, retrieve, and delete key-value pairs.
